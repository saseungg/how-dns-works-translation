    7: "멈춰!"
    8: "컴퓨터와 다른 기기들은 인터넷에서 서로를 식별하기 위해 IP 주소를 사용하여 통신하고 있어."
    9: "하지만 사람은 IP 주소를 기억하기 어렵기 때문에 단어를 사용하고 있지."
    10: "도메인 네임 시스템 (DNS)은 이 둘을 연결해서 목적지로 안내해 줘"
    11: "이게 DNS의 작동 방식이야"
    12: "잠깐! 뭐라고? 새로운 요청이 왔다고? 이 친구는 하루 종일 검색하는 게 전부인가 봐."
    13-1: "일단 dnsimple.com에 대해 내가 알고 있는지 확인해 봐야겠어, OS를 다시 귀찮게 하기 전에 말이야"

    19: "리졸버"
    20: "브라우저와 OS는 먼저 캐시를 조회하여 dnsimple.com의 IP 주소를 알고 있는지 확인했어. 그런데 알지 못해서 OS가 리졸버를 호출했지."
    21-1: "저 수수께끼의 리졸버는 누구일까요? 무슨 일을 하는 걸까요?"
    21-2: "DNS 작동 방식의 다음 에피소드에서 확인해보세요."

  ep2: 
    9: "나한테 새로운 요청이 왔네? 와-우"
    10: "dnsimple.com? 물론이지!" #todo: 오케이로 할지 고민
    11: "캐시를 먼저 확인해보자..."
    12-1: "없어!"
    12-2: "이 웹사이트를 어떻게 찾을까?"
    13: "루트에게 물어봐야지!"
    14-1: "리졸버 서버는 일반적으로 네 인터넷 서비스 제공자(ISP)에 있어. 모든 리졸버가 잘 알아야할 것 : 루트 서버의 위치" #todo: 맞게 번역했는지 확인필요
    14-2: "리졸버"
    15: "루트 서버는 .COM TLD 서버의 위치를 알고있어. TLD는 최상위 도메인을 의미해."
    16-1: "승객 여러분, 루트 서버로 향하는 R0XX 항공편에 오신 것을 환영합니다. 날씨는..."
    16-2: "내 취향의 여행이 아니야!"
    17: "몇 밀리초 후..."
    18-1: "저희와 함께 비행해주셔서 감사합니다. 다음에도 다시 탑승하실 수 있기를 바랍니다."

    22-2: "DNS 작동 방식의 다음 에피소드에서 확인해보세요."

  ep3:
    4: "다음!"
    5: "다아아아아음!!!"
    6: "무엇을 도와드릴까요?"
    7: "루트, 저는 웹사이트 dnsimple.com의 IP 주소를 찾고 있어요..."
    8: "어디에서 찾을 수 있는지 아세요?"
    9: "죄송해요, 리졸버. dnsimple.com을 찾을 수 있는 방법을 모르겠어요."
    10: "대신 .COM 최상위 도메인 서버를 찾을 수 있는 방법을 알려드릴게요!"
    11: ""
    12: "하지만 먼저, 이 정보를 저장해서 루트에게 다시 요청할 필요가 없도록 해야겠어."
    13: "이 루트 서버는 현재 존재하는 13개의 루트 네임 서버 중 하나에 불과해."
    14: "루트 서버는 DNS 계층 구조의 최상위에 위치하고있어."
    15: "전 세계에 흩어져 있으며 12개의 독립된 기관에 의해 운영되고 있지."
    16: "각각의 루트 서버는 [letter].root-servers.net라는 이름을 가지고 있으며 [letter]는 A부터 M까지 범위에 있어"
    17: "그렇다고 해서 인터넷 전체를 지원하기 위해 단지 13개의 루트 서버만 있는 것은 아니야!"
    18: "각 기관은 전 세계에 분산된 여러 개의 루트 서버를 운영하고 있어."
    23-1: "내 취향의 여행이 아니야"
    23-2: "그치만 지금 여기 있지..."
    24-1: ".COM TLD 서버는 리졸버에게 어떻게 도움을 줄까요?"
    24-2: "DNS 작동 방식의 다음 에피소드에서 확인해보세요."

  ep4:
    3: "Well, it's much more comfortable than I imagined..."
    4: "...What do you do when they recommend 'room temperature' for certain drinks?"
    6: "Sorry! I am looking for dnsimple.com, do you know where I can find it?"
    7: "Now, that's a great question!"
    8: "The coordination of most top-level domains (TLDs) belong to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)"
    9-1: "The .COM TLD was one of the first created in 1985."
    9-2: "And today, it is the largest TLD on the internet."
    10-1: "Other type of TLDs include:"
    10-2: "1. Country code TLDs. Usually, their 2 letter ISO code."
    11: "2. Internationalized country code TLDs."
    12-1: "3. Generic TLDs: .NET, .ORG, .EDU, etc..."
    12-2: "Usually, TLDs with 3 or more letters."
    13-1: "4. Infrastructure TLDs: .ARPA, mostly used for reverse DNS lookups."
    13-2: "The opposite of what we are doing now."
    13-3: "We are doing this:"
    13-4: "Reverse DNS does this:"
    14: "And today, many new generic TLDs are being created!"
    15: "Now, back to your question resolver!"
    16: "I am afraid I don't know the IP address for dnsimple.com"
    17: "But I have found the name servers!"
    18: "Great! I'll store that information for later"
    20: "The .COM found the authoritative name servers for the domain dnsimple.com."
    21-1: "But what do these names mean?"
    21-2: "We'll find out very soon..."
    22: "So the journey continues..."
    23-1: "Who are the authoritative name servers?"
    23-2: "Find out in the next episode of how DNS works."

  ep5:
    2: "How could the .COM TLD server point me to the authoritative name servers?"
    3: "How could he make the connection? There are so many .COM domains!"
    4: "Easy! With the help of the Domain Registrar!"
    5: "When a domain is purchased, the domain registrar reserves the name..."
    6: "... and communicates to the TLD registry the authoritative name servers."
    7: "We have arrived!"
    8: "Papers, please!"
    9: "Oh! I'll be quick. I have no intention of staying here. I am looking for ns1.dnsimple.com."
    10: "Papers, please!"
    11: "Oh boy! The only thing I have is a request for dnsimple.com. The .COM TLD told me that ns1.dnsimple.com could tell me where I could locate the IP address."
    12: "Well, in that case..."
    13: "I am ns1.dnsimple.com"
    14: "And I can provide you with that answer!"
    15: "Currently there are 4 of us that know how to resolve any domain managed by dnsimple.com"
    16-1: "We provide answers to DNS queries: Websites, e-mail, ..."
    16-2: "We are the ultimate authority on this stuff."
    17: "No cached values. Not asking someone else. Only the real deal."
    18: "You see, usually there is more than one name server attached to any domain."
    19-1: "You, the resolver, you are given this list in some unknown order."
    19-2: "You might query the first name server in the list."
    19-3: "OR NOT! We have to be ready!"
    20-1: "Because there is more of us, the work load is better distributed."
    20-2: "And the DNS zone availability is increased."
    21: "Especially in case of a failure!"
    22-1: "So if you want to know who are the authoritative name servers for your domain, run a WHOIS query."
    22-2: "There are a few websites that provide this information."
    23: "So here you go: 50.31.213.210"
    24: "What?"
    25-1: "dnsimple.com IP address is: 50.31.213.210"
    25-2: "Anything else?"
    26: "Uh, no. Thanks!"
    27: "I guess I'll save that."
    28: "The resolver finally got the answer he was looking for! Hurray for the Authoritative name server!"
    29: "Time to go home!"
    30-1: "Will the resolver make it back home in time?"
    30-2: "Find out in the next episode of how DNS works."

  ep6:
    3: "JETPACKS"
    4: "It was so cool visiting everyone!"
    5: "The root told me where to find the .COM server."
    6: "The TLD server gave me the Authoritative name servers addresses."
    7: "Then, ns1.dnsimple.com gave me the IP for dnsimple.com."
    8: "Finally, here we are, I can now deliver the answer."
    9: "JETPACKS"
    10: "Resolver! It's about time! I have been waiting a few milliseconds now. I thought you were lost!"
    11-1: "Hi OS! I'll tell you about my trip later."
    11-2: "Here is your answer..."
    12: "dnsimple.com IP address:"
    13: "Great! I'll save this so I don't have to bother you again if he asks for dnsimple.com."
    14: "Did someone mention me?"
    15: "Yes! Quick! Ask 50.31.213.210 whatever you need."
    16-1: "Finally! I was considering displaying one of those funny gifs to entertain my audience while you were away."
    16-2: "Oh, well, maybe later."
    17: "Connecting to 50.31.213.210"
    19: "Hi! Could you please send me your HTML content?"
    20: "Sure thing! On the way!"
    21: "Here we go..."
    24-1: "It's getting late."
    24-2: "I'll watch that last video on youtube."
    25: "Youtube? That, I know where to find!"
    26: "Well, we have completed our journey and this story is coming to an end."
    27: "We hope you have enjoyed it!"
    28: "Don't be a stranger! We're on twitter."
    29: "Thank you for reading!"
    31-1: "Is that it? Is this the end for real? No way!"
    31-2: "There is one more Bonus Episode!"
    31-3: "Read Bonus Episode"

  ep7:
    1: "Wait..."
    2: "Something is missing here!"
    3: "How could the resolver find 'ns1.dnsimple.com' before 'dnsimple.com'?"
    4: "Since 'ns1.dnsimple.com' is a subdomain of 'dnsimple.com', how could we resolve 'ns1.dnsimple.com' without resolving 'dnsimple.com' first?"
    5: "Isn't the search going backwards?"
    6: "Wouldn't we get stuck in a loop at some point?"
    7: "For example, let's say that the authoritative server for domain.com is ns1.domain.com"
    8-1: "If I wanted to browse domain.com, the .COM TLD would tell me to get the IP address from the authoritative server: ns1.domain.com"
    8-2: "Go ask ns1.domain.com"
    9-1: "ns1.domain.com is a subdomain of domain.com"
    9-2: "We cannot get to a subdomain without getting to the domain first!"
    10: "Stuck in a loop!"
    11: "So, what happened? How come the resolver was able to find 'dnsimple.com' through 'ns1.dnsimple.com'?"
    12-1: "Simple!"
    12-2: "Glue records!"
    13: "Glue records?"
    14: "Exactly!"
    15-1: "Awesome!"
    15-2: "I'll explain then!"
    16: "When the resolver asked the .COM TLD about dnsimple.com, extra information was attached to that response."
    17: "The resolver got at least one IP address for each name server."
    18: "We call that the glue!"
    19: "So the resolver not only got the name of the authoritative name server, it also got the IP address."
    20: "Thus breaking the circular dependency."
    21: "Nice! I understand it now!"
    22: "Glue records rock!"
    23-1: "Yes, they do!"
    23-2: "hahaha, thanks!"
    25: "You made it through the end! Now is a good time to watch the video that we made for this comic!"
    26-1: "Watch this short animation based on this comic. They finally have a voice!"
    26-2: "Watch video"
